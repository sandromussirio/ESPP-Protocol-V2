## Role of AI in the ESPP Workflow

The ESPP is defined as a declarative spatial language.

Language models and AI systems may assist the workflow at specific stages,
such as translating source data into ESPP-compliant descriptions,
validating structural consistency, generating execution scripts,
or producing visual representations for early spatial validation.

In all cases, AI participation is constrained to execution, translation,
and validation tasks.  
No spatial inference, design decisions, or geometric completion
are permitted at the protocol level.

All spatial intent must remain explicit, human-defined,
and fully auditable through deterministic rules.
