________________________________________
I, Sandro Resende Mussi, hereby declare that I am the original author and creator of the system entitled ESPP – Efficient Spatial Prompt Protocol, originally developed from September 2025 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The ESPP is a technical protocol and declarative language for spatial description, designed to convert two-dimensional geometric representations—such as coordinate lists extracted from architectural drawings (e.g., LIST commands or equivalent sources)—into deterministic JSON structures, interpretable by Python-based execution engines and executable within three-dimensional modeling environments, including Blender or any other software capable of processing Python or JSON-based workflows.
The protocol defines, in its current state, a deterministic workflow based on the following chain:
LIST → JSON → Execution Engine → 3D Modeling
Within this workflow, each architectural element is described explicitly through:
•	geometric coordinates,
•	vertical positioning (Z),
•	extrusion values,
•	chromatic attributes (RGB),
•	and semantic layers,
thereby eliminating manual three-dimensional modeling and any form of automatic inference or subjective interpretation.
The ESPP is defined as a software-independent protocol, and may be implemented by different engines or technical adapters, provided that its conceptual, structural, and deterministic principles are fully preserved.
